# Thermodynamic_data_analysis
Developing a Toolbox to analyze Vapour Liquid Equilibria data
Contains classes and functions that help to design a Binary Distillation Column based on NRTL model. <br>
Transient characteristics of Distillation tower can be simulated for real time analysis, <br>
Also contains a Cooling Tower design code inbuilt with the Distillation Column model. <br>
The jupyter notebooks named 18CHE147... show how to use the utilities.
