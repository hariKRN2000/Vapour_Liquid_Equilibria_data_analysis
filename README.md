# Thermodynamic_data_analysis
Developing a Toolbox to analyze Vapour Liquid Equilibria data
Contains classes and functions that help to design a Binary Distillation Column based on NRTL model.
Transient characteristics of Distillation tower can be simulated for real time analysis
Also contains a Cooling Tower design code inbuilt with the Distillation Column model
